# WHMCS Discord Connection

## Maybe works
I don't have access to WHMCS anymore, here are some changes that may work

This will let paying customers get a Discord role by going to /discord.php.
I will not be providing support for this repository.

If you like it then give it a star! ðŸŒŸ

## Installation
1. Add the `discord.php` file to the root of your WHMCS installation

2. Change the variables in `discord.php`.

3. [Create a custom field to customers called `discord`. This will contain the customer's Discord ID.](https://docs.whmcs.com/Custom_Client_Fields)

4. Add the `discord.tpl` to your theme's directory.
